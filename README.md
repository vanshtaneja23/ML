Diabetes Prediction Using Linear Regression
Introduction

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction project! This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model that predicts diabetes progression using linear regression. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib, this project aims to provide an insightful analysis and visualization of diabetes data.

About the Project
In this project, we utilize the diabetes dataset from scikit-learn, focusing on a specific feature for predicting diabetes progression. By training a linear regression model, we aim to provide accurate predictions and evaluate the model's performance using mean squared error.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Extracting and preparing the relevant features and target variables from the diabetes dataset.
Model Training: Implementing a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy through mean squared error metrics.
Data Visualization: Visualizing the relationship between the predicted and actual values using matplotlib.
